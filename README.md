### CS347
##Compilers Lab CS347

Follow the following steps to run the compiler:
1. make clean
2. make
3. Put your input program in the 'inputfile'
4. run ./parser outtree
The compiled MIPS file will be in 'codefinal.s' and the intermediate code in 'intcode'. The 'outtree' will have the annotated parse tree and the 'output' file will have the grammar reductions.
